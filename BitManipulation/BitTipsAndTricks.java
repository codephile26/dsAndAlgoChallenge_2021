	//to divide a binary number by two
	// n >>= 1

	// To Multiply a binary number by two
	// n <<= 1

	// to calculate nth power of two
	// 1 << n
	// for simplicity let us suppose our binary numbers are represented in 8 bit form.
	// think logically - 1 << 0 - it is represented in 8 bit form as 00000001 - which is 2^0
	// second option - 1 << 1 - represented in 8 bit form as 00000010 - which is 2^1
	// third option - 1 << 2 - represented in 8 bit form as 00000100 -which is 2^2

	//To multiply a number n by xth power of 2
	// n << x  is equivalent to n * 2^x
